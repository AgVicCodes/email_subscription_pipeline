Justification:
Data Volume & Velocity: High-volume, high-velocity data streams where 
waiting for batch windows would hinder operations or user experience.

What can I do to improve this project

Thought for a second
Based on a quick review of your repository, here are several suggestions to improve the project:

1. Enhance Documentation
Clarify the Project Goals: The README mentions both “low latency” and “high latency” in different parts. Decide on one description (or explain why both might apply) to avoid confusion.
Usage Instructions: Include step-by-step instructions on how to set up the environment, run the simulation, and integrate with downstream systems. Document any configuration (e.g., what’s expected in db.json).
Contribution Guidelines: Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file if you plan to invite collaborators.
2. Code Quality and Organization
Fix Typos: For example, the filename subsription_event.py appears to be misspelled. Correct it to subscription_event.py to maintain clarity and consistency.
Code Structure: Consider modularizing the code further (e.g., separating database operations, email generation, and transformation logic into their own modules).
Error Handling & Logging: Enhance the robustness by adding exception handling (e.g., when reading files or connecting to the database) and integrating a logging framework instead of using print statements.
3. Testing and Continuous Integration
Unit and Integration Tests: Introduce tests (using pytest or another framework) for each component of the pipeline. This will help ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.
CI/CD Integration: Set up GitHub Actions to automatically run your tests on commits and pull requests. This ensures ongoing code quality and faster feedback during development.
4. Database and Data Handling Improvements
Connection Handling: In staging.py, after creating the SQLAlchemy engine, include proper connection management. This may involve context managers or a dedicated database handler class.
Data Persistence: Instead of writing directly to a JSON file for DB configuration, consider using environment variables or a dedicated configuration library (like Python’s built-in configparser or pydantic) for better security and flexibility.
Data Simulation Enhancements: Expand the faker script to simulate a broader range of edge cases and realistic signup events. You might also consider parameterizing the number of events to simulate.
5. Integration with Airflow
DAG Development: Since your README mentions integrating with Airflow, create a sample DAG that schedules and monitors the email simulation tasks. This can serve both as a functional demo and documentation for future improvements.
Task Orchestration: Break down the pipeline into Airflow tasks (e.g., one task for generating emails, one for transformation, and one for loading data into the database). This not only aligns with best practices for Airflow but also makes the pipeline more maintainable.
6. Additional Considerations
Configuration Management: Introduce a configuration file or environment variable handling mechanism so that critical settings (like database connection details) can be adjusted without modifying the code.
Scalability: Consider abstracting the processing logic so that the project can eventually support real-time processing or integration with message queues (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) if scaling beyond a simulation is needed.
Documentation of Dependencies: Detail the dependencies (in requirements.txt) and provide instructions on how to create a virtual environment. This helps new contributors quickly set up a working development environment.
Implementing these improvements should make your project more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any of these areas!

1. Daily Batch ETL with Manual Triggers

How It Works:

Incoming email data is written to a staging area (like a database table or flat files).
A cron job or scheduler triggers an ETL process only once per day (or on another infrequent schedule).
The ETL job processes the entire batch, performs necessary transformations and enrichments, and then loads the data into the final data store.

Why It’s High Latency:

Data is not processed until the next scheduled job, potentially leaving emails in the staging area for up to 24 hours (or longer).
If manual intervention is required to start or monitor the job, delays can increase further.


2. Synchronous, Chained Microservices Without Asynchronous Messaging

How It Works:

The email subscription event flows through several microservices in a strict synchronous chain.
For example, one service validates the email, the next enriches the data (e.g., fetching additional user details), and a third persists the data to a database.
Each microservice must wait for the previous one to complete before it can start processing.

Why It’s High Latency:

Each synchronous call introduces waiting time.
If any single microservice experiences delays or downtime, the entire chain slows down, causing significant cumulative latency.


3. Legacy SOAP-Based Integration with Synchronous API Calls

How It Works:

The email data is sent to a legacy system via SOAP-based web services.
The system makes synchronous API calls to external services for validation or enrichment.
Each SOAP call waits for a response before proceeding to the next step in the pipeline.

Why It’s High Latency:

SOAP APIs tend to be heavier and less efficient than modern REST or streaming APIs.
Synchronous operations block the flow until a response is received, and legacy systems often do not scale well under load.


4. Polling-Based Ingestion with Long Poll Intervals

How It Works:

Instead of using an event-driven or push-based mechanism, the system periodically polls a data source (e.g., a remote log file or external system API) to detect new email subscriptions.
Polling occurs on a fixed schedule, such as every 15 minutes or every hour.

Why It’s High Latency:

New events might be created just after a poll and then have to wait until the next polling cycle to be detected.
The delay introduced by the polling interval can lead to an overall latency that is determined by the length of the interval plus processing time.


5. Synchronous API Gateway with Sequential Database Writes

How It Works:

An API gateway receives email subscription requests and immediately writes them to a relational database.
Before the API responds to the client, it synchronously calls additional internal services (or even external systems) to perform data validation, transformation, and then writes the results to multiple tables.
The response is sent only after all sequential operations are completed.

Why It’s High Latency:

Each database write and synchronous service call adds to the overall response time.
In high-traffic scenarios, sequential processing can cause a backlog, where each request waits its turn for multiple round-trips to the database and other services.
