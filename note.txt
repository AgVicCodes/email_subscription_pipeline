Segment important sections and dont miss out on anything 
Reasoned for 12 seconds
Below is an outline for a PowerPoint presentation that covers every important section of your Project and Data Management Plan. Each slide is segmented to ensure no details are missed.

Slide 1 – Title Slide
• Title: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition and Evaluation Using CNNs
• Subtitle: Project and Data Management Plan
• (Optional: Add your name, institution, and date)

Slide 2 – Project Overview
• Project Title: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition and Evaluation Using CNNs
• Summary:
 – Develop and compare various frameworks/models for recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions.
 – Focus on expressions ranging from simple formulas to complex limits and high-degree polynomials.
• Dataset:
 – Primary: Aida Calculus Math Handwriting Recognition Dataset (from Kaggle).
 – Contains synthetically generated images with embedded LaTeX labels and detailed JSON metadata.
• Goal: Identify the most effective OCR framework for this challenging task.

Slide 3 – Literature Review (Part 1)
• Hong-Yu et al. (2025):
 – Architecture: YOLOv5-m for symbol detection combined with a 3-layer transformer decoder (Vision Language Pre-training).
 – Datasets: Trained on CROHME; tested on CROHME and HME100K.
 – Results:
  * Pre-training alone achieved low F1 scores (0.18–0.21).
  * Training (with/without pre-training) reached F1 scores of 0.96–0.99, with minor improvements from pre-training.
• Key Takeaway:
 – CNN-based approaches can be very effective, with pre-training offering modest gains in generalization.

Slide 4 – Literature Review (Part 2)
• Navaneetha Krishnan M et al. (2023):
 – Compared CNN frameworks (VGG, LeNet, ResNet, etc.).
 – Preprocessing: Conversion to grayscale, noise reduction, image segmentation.
 – Outcome: LeNet outperformed others with a 98% accuracy using the CROHME dataset.
• Zhu et al. (2024):
 – Proposed CNN-Tr model comprising: feature extractor, CNN with transformer encoder, and CTC transcriptor.
 – Evaluated on Im2Latex-100k and IBEM datasets.
 – Performance: Achieved a Token Error Rate of 93.8, outperformed several state-of-the-art non-transformer models; only DNN-RL exceeded it with 96.5.
• Conclusion from Reviews:
 – CNN-based models are highly efficient.
 – LeNet is a strong baseline, with future exploration into LSTM, feedforward networks, and transformers to further improve results.

Slide 5 – Research Question & Objectives
• Research Question:
 – What framework is most effective in recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions?
• Project Objectives:
 – Compare multiple CNN-based frameworks, including variants with LSTM, feedforward neural networks, and transformers.
 – Evaluate performance metrics (accuracy, recall, F1 score) and generalization across dataset subsets.
 – Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each framework against the ground truth LaTeX labels.

Slide 6 – Project Plan
• Task List:
 – Conduct a thorough literature review.
 – Extract and transform data from JSON files.
 – Develop and maintain the project and document management plan.
 – Perform exploratory data analysis.
 – Process detailed image metadata (dimensions, bounding boxes, PNG masks).
 – Develop the CNN-based OCR framework.
 – Train models using processed data.
 – Compare model performance using standard metrics (accuracy, F1 score).
 – Document the process and prepare presentation materials.
 – Finalize the report and presentation slides.
• Timeline:
 – (Outline timeline details as per your project schedule.)

Slide 7 – Data Management Plan
• Dataset Overview:
 – Created for Aida, a Pearson Higher Education tutoring application for calculus.
 – Contains approximately 100,000 images in 10 batches with corresponding JSON files.
 – Total size: Approximately 11 GB, with each JSON file holding ~10,000 records including image dimensions, bounding boxes, and PNG masks.
• Document Control & Versioning:
 – Repository: Handwritten Mathematical Expression GitHub Repository.
 – Regular commits (approx. four times per week) using snake case naming conventions.
 – Comprehensive README detailing reproducibility, installation, usage, dependencies, and security.
 – Weekly backups on OneDrive (MSc. Data Science and Machine Learning Project).
• Ethical Requirements:
 – Dataset is synthetically generated with no personal data.
 – Fully compliant with GDPR and University Ethical Policies, with ethically obtained permissions.

What other things shoould I add to the slide?
Reasoned for 7 seconds
Here are some additional elements you might consider adding:

• A "Methodology/Approach" slide that details your overall workflow—from data extraction and pre-processing through model training and evaluation. A diagram or flowchart can visually illustrate this process.

• A dedicated "Timeline and Milestones" slide with a visual timeline showing key deliverables and deadlines, helping to clarify project progression.

• An "Architecture & Tools" slide to outline the technical framework. You could include details like the deep learning libraries, programming languages, and any hardware specifics, along with a high-level diagram of your CNN and additional modules.

• A "Risk Management & Mitigation" slide where you list potential challenges (e.g., data quality issues, training time constraints) and your plans to address them.

• A "Results & Expected Outcomes" slide to outline what metrics (accuracy, recall, F1 score) you will be using to compare the frameworks, as well as any anticipated outcomes or benchmarks.

• A "Conclusions & Future Work" slide to summarize key takeaways and suggest directions for further research or improvements beyond this project.

• An "Acknowledgements" slide (if applicable) to credit contributors or funding sources.

These additions can provide a more comprehensive view of your project and guide your audience through each stage of your work.
